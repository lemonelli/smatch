 When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, partisans of Ronald Reagan claimed he had "won" the cold war.
 Although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true, the claim was that the Soviet Union became overextended attempting to keep up with Ray-gun's defense spending.
 Pappy Bush, who was the president at the time, claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the Soviet Union happened on his watch.
 Regardless of how one views those claims, for many people -- capitalists especially -- heralded the "victory" of capitalism.
 Globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their "victory," and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world.
 Always impatient of any restaint, capitalists used this so-called victory as justification for the opposition to, or calls for the roll-back of any regulatory restraint.
 But not everyone has agreed with that view of the world and of economic systems.
 Now, with the various "Occupy" movements, it is (or ought to be) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies, as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest.
 What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities?
 @Setanta, Unfettered capitalism has yielded an Oligarchy.
 Governmental regulation is good for capitalisms evolution.
 Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity.
 @Setanta, I don't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism.
 I agree with this completely.
 Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules, plays by the rules and enforces the rules.
 If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules, understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules, that is where trouble really begins.
 That's the problem with "deregulation".
 Removing rules doesn't help business be more competitive, it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there.
 It's like changing the rules to Monopoly half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless.
 That's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you.
 Out of all of the examples I saw, the only one I would agree with is the bomb toting Arab.
 That is extremely rude, though I can see the humor in it.
 In a college, that kind of costume should not have a place.
 But these kids are listing Geisha costumes, sombreros + donkeys, and a few other costumes that they deem 'racially insensitive'
 Racially insensitive?
 Have they not been to Mexico?
 That is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities.
 How is that being insulting?
 It is not showing someone doing something derogatory, it is using the clothes of a society for a costume.
 A Geisha is insensitive too.
 Again, ( my opinion only) this is taking it way over board.
 Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended.
 It is about perspective frankly.
 There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it.
 Dressing in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that.
 And why is it that only those races/cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive?
 Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over alls, stained shirt, black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly?
 What about the woman who wears shorts, high heels and too much make up to be a hooker?
 There has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive.
 And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads, they will always find justification no matter what.
 But why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super PC behavior?
 Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination?
 And why are these rules only applied to two or three races?
 Americans, white, black, green, blue, short, tall, fat..
 what have you, are ALL being made fun of in some way when it comes to costumes and halloween but only those 3 races get the red light?
 Isnt THAT racist?
 These students are bleeding idealism and haven't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one's cultural obsessions and that these costumes aren't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be.
 This is an absolutely ridiculous thread.
 I mean if racist costumes were actually being banned, you all might have a point.
 I am as uptight about the plight of white people in the US as anyone is.
 But did anyone else read the article?
 No one is banning Halloween costumes..
 No one is even talking about banning Halloween costumes.
 In fact no one in this story wants to ban anything, except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters.
 These students have a simple goal.
 They say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think, then that's awesome".
 They aren't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything.
 This story is about students expressing free speech.
 They are making posters expressing their opinion.
 Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech.
 But me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech.
 Neither should be banned.
 And that is the way it works.
 Whether your costume involves black face and a noose, or whether it is a grilled sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant.
 Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the "banning" that is being alleged.
 You all have turned this story on it's end.
 SO dear Massachusetters, does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting Republican Senator, Scott Brown?
 Why does Scott Brown need to be dethroned? I kinda like him...
 Could Elizabeth Warren beat Scott Brown?
 i'm not sure what either of them look like, but the most brutal fight i ever saw was a girl fight, lots of kicking, scratching, and some amazing punches (the loser had to stay home from school for almost a week until swelling went down around her eyes)
 so i'm gonna say yes
 I'm thinking in terms of the Democratic Party getting one more Senate seat.
 In Massachusetts, it would seem a lot easier task then in other Senate races.
 I'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate Republicans we have right where they are.
 He may vote along party lines for most things but he's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal-leaning constituency.
 Don't know, but it sounds like a real bellweather contest, doesn't it?
 It would have made for some really great off year contest.
 Care to explain why you think he is an idiot?
 He did beat Martha Coakley rather convincingly.
 He served as a State Senator for several years.
 He even voted for several Dem bills.
 Coakley was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made.
 As for Brown, he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion.
 I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all, and several which are really just embarrassing.
 I haven't really been active in (or even really cared about) politics until recently and I'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this.
 Well, just telling you who I'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right?
 What issues are important to you?
 Obama because I think he has done a good job in most areas; some areas he let me down, plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today.
 (I have a few times in the past, mostly local)
 Anyone who is not a Republican.
 I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important.
 They are willing to throw America under the bus in order to make Obama look bad.
 OK, "and why" does add a lot, you're right.
 I'm voting for Obama because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances, and can do much more with another term, and because I really worry about what any of the possible Republican nominees would do as president if one of them won.
 I also wouldn't vote for just about any republican (especially Rick Perry) but I have heard some good things about Ron Paul, he's about the only republican that I'm actually interested in learning more about.
 My own opinion of Ron Paul is that I'm happy that he's in the race, and especially in debates.
 I like how he's anti-war and anti-bullshit in general.
 I would absolutely not want him to be president, though.
 Andrew Sullivan has a lot of posts on him, that might be a good place to start if you're interested in learning more.
 Here's his un-endorsement of Ron Paul (he endorsed him, then had second thoughts):
 I read a fascinating piece in the WSJ today.
 The author spoke about how Obama's approval ratings are at a dismal low.
 He apparently appears to be unable to pull Congress together to accomplish much, and in the author's opinion, it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term.
 He would like Obama to bow out for a 2nd term, and have Hillary Clinton run for president.
 He believes that Hillary has the best chance of bringing the country together.
 I don't know how she feels about running, but, IMO, I think that it is a great idea.
 She certainly has the smarts, the experience, and the approval of the majority of citizens.
 I think that the people on the Republican side of the fence, are a poor bunch.
 There is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the American people.
 The voters who will decide this election, IMO are the moderates and the independents. THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti-gay, pro-life bible bangers.
 What do you think?
 Should Obama step down for the good of the country?
 Should Hillary run?
 Hillary's time has come, and gone...
 She would make her self no friend of the Democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote...
 No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. Obama, and a whole lot less Obama voters will vote for her...
 Don't worry though..
 She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party...
 Best case scenario: Obama gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the Democrats gain a greater foothold of the US Senate and increase their collective mass in the US Congress.
 Worst case scenario: George W. Bush II (any Republican candidate other then Huntsman, Romney, or Ron Paul) will take the election.
 Then that means the Republicans would likely further gain in Congress and even the Senate perhaps.
 Then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions.
 I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates, and especially the ones you call tea baggers.
 Actually, I think you are wrong on the moderate/independent voter turnout, too, but I could be wrong.
 I'm expecting a fairly good anti Obama turnout amongst that group.
 I could accept Hillary.
 Like Phoenix, I'm not greatly impressed by the Republican field.
 Not crazy about the presumed Democratic candidate either.
 On the other hand, Obama stepping aside seems even less likely than Cain giving up.
 I guess that in summary, I'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years.
 Kudos to NY!. They realize that it's not about just voting the party line, it's about voting for what's right.
 @jcboy, Did they actually vote for gay marriage yet?
 I'm getting a mixed message with the NY Times
 @tsarstepan, They sure did!
 Hopefully, other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody.
 Look at Massachusetts. They have had it since 2004.
 Have you heard of their society falling apart? Of course not.
 I think with NY, then CA, it will rapidly spread across the country.
 You can't stop this train!
 @jcboy, I hope that the US Congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law.
 @jcboy, You are correct.
 Whether one's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter.
 When I studied the Domestic Relations Law of NY, I thought it was a damned INDIGNITY for a government to give permission to citizens to marry.
 The citizens created the damned government, their child. David
 Did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter?
 I have no idea how that happened.
 What do you think?
 That is a congested airway, and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers.
 Accidents happen, but this particular area may need additional regulation (such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters).
 My husband, our kids, and myself were spending a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids, our long-time friends.
 At some point we came across a huge fallen tree, and our friend L. climbed on it and started walking up.
 Our 11 year-old son followed him, but L. suddenly realized they won't be able to get down that easily.
 He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down, too.
 Our son stopped but didn't get out of his way at once.
 He was having fun, and we had to tell him 2 more times, and then he obeyed.
 After that L. got back down, and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might, yelling at him.
 We were stupefied.
 A 215lbs 38 year old man could have easily injured him.
 Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened.
 We are in deep shock, we never hit our children.
 Does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary?
 Is there any point in filing a police report?
 Personally, if someone is my friend, I am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level.
 Why can't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you don't want them hitting your kids ever again.
 Legally, there are two remedies.
 There is monetary damages, and there is jail time.
 I suppose you could add probation (but that is just a replacement for jail time).
 If you go the legal route, that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens.
 If I was angry enough to start down this path I wouldn't worry about where it ended up.
 I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again.
 Your son was assaulted.
 That is what the behaviour of your ex-friend would be named legally.
 He didn't hurt your child physically, so it was the lesser form of assault (assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious.)
 You certainly could file a police report....
 I don't know the law where you are, here, it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man, making it clear that (if your description is accurate) he had committed an offence, but you could decide against filing charges.
 Again, depending on where you live, you could likely notyify child protection authorities.
 here, being extra-familial, and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again, they would simply hand it to police.
 If you release a legal genie from the bottle, though, you lose control of what the genie does.
 For instance, you and your son would need to make a formal statement.
 It might be that police act even if you don't want them to.
 It might go to court.
 I'd personally not choose to do it tthat way...though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat, or a formal caution to be had in your area.
 I'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him.
 However, my concern would be how he treats his own kids.
 That was one hell of an over-reaction.
 If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids, I'd be considering a chold protection notification.
 is your kid ok?
 That would have been scary.
 Is he having nightmares or anything?
 I'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour.
 It didn't warrant such a reaction, but he was thoughtless.
 If it was really unusual behaviour from your friend, I am a bit worried about him, too, frankly.
 I am a 25 year old woman, and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man.
 He has 2 kids one, from his marriage and one from a previous relationship.
 He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met,
 things are so heated between us, I don't know what to do.
 He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year, he and his wife do not see eye to eye.
 He was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from Sweden,
 when I found out it affected me really badly.
 I felt and still feel betrayed and I can't trust him.
 How do I let go?
 @JEJE, You just walk away.
 Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do?
 A married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now, or at least move out of his house now.
 A man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others.
 Personally, when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get.
 I have little or no pity for you.
 But, you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him.
 Then why don't you think about looking for someone who is not attached.
 Your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion.
